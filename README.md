# CNN-for-Car-Recognition-using-Keras
Simple Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network — Deep Learning in python.

This Jupyter notebook contains code for Car Recognizer. CNN is written in python language using Keras machine library to recognize car.

The process of building a Convolutional Neural Network always involves four major steps.

Step - 1 : Convolution,
Step - 2 : Pooling,
Step - 3 : Flattening,
Step - 4 : Full connection

## Installation:
Installing Tensorflow using pip install tensorflow
Install sklearn using sudo pip install sklearn
Install keras using sudo pip install keras
