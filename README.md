# CNN-for-Car-Recognition-using-Keras
Simple Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network — Deep Learning in python.

This Jupyter notebook contains code for *Car Recognizer*. `CNN` is written in python language using Keras machine library which achieves over *96%* accuracy.

The process of building a Convolutional Neural Network always involves four major steps.

-Step 1: Convolution <br />
-Step 2: Pooling <br />
-Step 3: Flattening <br />
-Step 4: Full connection <br />

## Installation:
-Installing `Tensorflow` using `pip install tensorflow`
-Install `sklearn` using `sudo pip install sklearn`
-Install `keras` using `sudo pip install keras`
-Install `skimage` using `sudo pip install scikit-image`

## Run:
Use Jupyter notebook IDE
